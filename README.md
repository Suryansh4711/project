# Java Arithmetic Operations Practice Project

A simple Java practice project implementing basic arithmetic operations for learning and collaboration.

## 📋 Overview

This project contains Java programs that demonstrate fundamental arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Each operation is implemented as a separate Java class with user input functionality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- A Java IDE or text editor
- Command line access

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. Compile any Java file:
   ```bash
   javac addition.java
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java addition
   ```

Repeat steps 2-3 for other operations (Subtraction.java, Multiplication.java, Division.java).

## 📁 Project Structure
